# 2048: A Haskell Odyssey

I wrote command-line 2048 inefficiently in Haskell.
Don't ask questions.

## Usage

```
$ ghc Main.hs
```

Then run the executable built. To play, enter key below and hit enter.

```
w -> Up
a -> Left
s -> Down
d -> Right
```

Don't spam keys, I didn't write this program *that* well.
To exit, just hit the wrong key -- I forgot to implement
error handling!
